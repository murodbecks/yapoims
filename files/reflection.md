# YAPOIMS  -  Reflection

The design of `yapoims` was fundamentally shaped by the constraints of the assignment and a series of deliberate trade-offs aimed at balancing functionality, robustness, and simplicity. Three key decisions highlight this balancing act.

First was the choice of an **in-memory data model versus a persistent one**. The system loads its entire state from a YAML configuration file at startup and operates purely in memory. It does not write changes back to the file. This was a significant trade-off: we gained immense speed and architectural simplicity by avoiding file I/O for every operation and the complexity of database management. The constraint was the assignment's focus on CLI interaction and querying within a single session, which did not require data persistence beyond startup. This made the in-memory approach the most practical solution, prioritizing session performance over data permanence.

Second, the management of **entity identifiers (IDs)** was a critical design point. The initial thought was to allow users to specify IDs in the configuration file. However, this would introduce significant validation complexity (ensuring uniqueness, proper format, etc.). The trade-off was made to treat IDs as a purely internal concept. The system generates unique, timestamp-based IDs at runtime for every new POI and visitor. This simplified the configuration file for the end-user (who now only needs to provide human-readable names) and guaranteed ID uniqueness without complex validation logic, shifting the burden from the user to the system itself.

Finally, the design of the **POI type system prioritized flexibility over strictness**. Instead of requiring all POI types to be pre-defined, the system allows a new POI to be created with a previously unseen type. When this happens, the system implicitly creates the new type category. The trade-off here is user convenience versus the risk of data inconsistency from typos (e.g., creating both "restaurant" and "resturant" as distinct types). Given the context of a command-line tool where rapid data entry is common, this flexibility was deemed more valuable, empowering the user to extend the data model on the fly without navigating back to a separate "manage types" menu.

Together, these trade-offs resulted in a system that is robust, performant for its intended scope, and user-friendly, directly reflecting the constraints and objectives of the assignment.
