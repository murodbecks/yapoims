"Alright, in my view I need to implement 4 classes: `POI` (for each POI), `GroupOfPois` (for group of POIs), `Visitor` (for each visitor), `PoiMS` (for managing everything else). I want it to be synchronous, so I probably need 2 files (either jsonl or yaml, I need advice on advantages and disadvantages of both) that will work as database for POIs and Visitors. Every time when I do operation on POI or Visitor, they'll be updated. 

I am at the beginning of the project, so I am planning. And I am here to discuss those designs. What do you think about my assessment?",had a discussion about my design choices -> learned more on the internet -> modified
what is the difference between storing the data (data persistance) and configuration? I am struggling to wrap my head around what is the input file to be loaded by the program.,tried to clarify what I was struggling to understand -> discussed with other students -> accepted

So, I want you to take 20+ various POIs in Abu Dhabi and try to map it into 1000x1000 map. Add relevant poi_types. Then, create 25+ visitors from different nationalities and interests. 

The assignment asked us to write robust scripts for loading from yaml file, so small mistakes or some edge cases are welcome but make sure it is not too much. Can you help me with that?

I have come to the config files. So, `PoiManagementSystem` class can take `config_file_path` (if provided) and should parse the yaml file. There is `sample.yaml` file. One of the requirements is having unique ids for pois and visitors. Then, I am having some question on whether config file should have ids? If yes, what if there is duplicate ids? If no, should config file have no ids and I should write my own function to generate unique ids? what do you think?

"Okay, I hear you but let's cut some corners and make our life easier. shall we? After thinking a bit, I decided to keep id only internally and changed `sample.yaml` file for this. So, users can't specify id even for POIs. We will generate all ids for internal usage. Also, I am making POI types more relaxed (not strict). So, we can extend it with POI attributes and etc. 

Then, I started writing the `main.py` file. Here is current version.

But, somewhere along the adding and deleting pois, poi_types, visitors and etc, I think I am missing something. Can you check my code for potential misses and bugs?

Remember to generate clear and concise test cases that checks from basic things to some edge cases. Don't generate too much tests. Just handful but high quality ones are enough. Can you help me generating `test_visitor.py` file?

I am working on `cli.py` file now. Currently it is good but some functions are not implemented or not working properly. Here is some examples:
```
------------------------------
POI MANAGEMENT
------------------------------
1. Add POI Type
2. Add POI
3. Delete POI
4. Delete POI Type
5. List POIs by Type
6. Rename POI Type
7. Manage POI Type Attributes
0. Back to Main Menu

Enter your choice: 2
Available POI types: museum, landmark, theme_park, park, restaurant, mall, beach
Enter POI name: MBZUAI
Enter POI type: university
Invalid POI type. Available types: ['museum', 'landmark', 'theme_park', 'park', 'restaurant', 'mall', 'beach']
```
could not enter non-existent POI type, but I designed the PoiManagementClass such that Poi types are more flexible and we can add new type.

we are missing `system_information_submenu`, `view_visitor_details` and some other functions that I am not explored yet. How can I make `cli.py` complete with all things working properly?

Now, it is time to write a report and reflection. Here is the criteria:
```
Report (40%)
•Design & Data Model: entities, invariants and (if used) persistence format.
•Edge Policies: boundary ε, tie-break rules, counting rules (distinct vs. repeated visits),
coordinate bounds.
•Usage Guide: sample menu session + sample configuration.
•Reflection (300–500 words): trade-offs and constraints that shaped the design.
```

I am also uploading AI Usage logsheet that have prompts that I used throughout the building the project. So, it contains some decisions went into designing. 

We can write both report and reflection in markdown format and convert to pdf at the end (not now). Both should be clear and concise, clearly stating the points and thinking process that lead to that decision. Avoid any AI slop that is looks good but annoying to read as it has too much slop. can you help me writing these?",asked to write a report and reflection -> read through -> modified
